This extension lets you download music from Vkontakte. What sets it apart from any other same extension
is that it does not transform .m3u8 URL to get .mp3 URL as some URLs fail to transform correctly. vkAudio
gets every piece of audio stream and converts .ts files to .mp3. It also doesn't create ugly download buttons
on audio items. Instead it puts the extra option in the context menu when user hovers over "..." button on audio item.
